    <h2>Why Choose VitaCal Over Yazio?</h2>

    <h3>AI Photo Logging on Free</h3>
    <p>Yazio locks AI photo meal logging behind its Pro subscription. VitaCal includes 5 AI photo analyses per week on the free plan. You can try the core feature without paying anything.</p>

    <h3>Lower Price Point</h3>
    <p>Yazio Pro ranges from $7-15/month depending on the plan. VitaCal's Starter plan is $3/month for 15 AI analyses per week -- less than half the cost of Yazio's cheapest paid tier.</p>

    <h3>Built for Women</h3>
    <p>Yazio targets everyone. VitaCal is designed for women with a supportive, guilt-free approach. No shaming when you go over your targets. Clear information that helps you make choices that feel right.</p>

    <h3>Photo Privacy</h3>
    <p>VitaCal deletes your meal photos immediately after AI analysis. Yazio stores photos on its servers. For users who care about meal photo privacy, this is a significant difference.</p>

    <h2>When Yazio Might Be Better</h2>
    <p>Yazio offers intermittent fasting tools, barcode scanning, recipe import, and a large food database. If you practise intermittent fasting or need barcode scanning for packaged foods, Yazio has more built-in tools. Yazio also offers meal plans and recipes as part of its Pro subscription.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>VitaCal is the better choice for women who want fast AI photo logging at a lower price with strong privacy. Yazio is better for users who want a comprehensive nutrition platform with fasting, recipes, and barcode scanning.</p>
