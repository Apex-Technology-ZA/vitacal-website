    <h3>No Ads, Ever</h3>
    <p>MyFitnessPal's free tier includes banner ads and pop-ups. VitaCal has no advertising on any tier.</p>

    <h2>When MyFitnessPal Might Be Better</h2>
    <p>If you need a massive food database with barcode scanning, MyFitnessPal is unmatched. Its 14M+ entries mean you can find almost any packaged food.
