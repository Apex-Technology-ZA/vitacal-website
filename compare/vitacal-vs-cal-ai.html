    <h2>Why Choose VitaCal Over Cal AI?</h2>

    <h3>Built for Women</h3>
    <p>Cal AI targets a general audience. VitaCal was designed specifically for women who want a supportive, non-judgmental approach to nutrition tracking. No red alerts for going over your calorie budget. No shame -- just clear information.</p>

    <h3>More Affordable</h3>
    <p>Cal AI subscriptions start around $10/month with no free tier beyond a trial. VitaCal offers a generous free plan (5 AI analyses per week plus unlimited manual logging), with paid plans starting at just $3/month.</p>

    <h3>Privacy First</h3>
    <p>When you snap a meal photo with VitaCal, it's analysed and immediately deleted from our servers. Cal AI stores your photos. If meal photo privacy matters to you, VitaCal is the better choice.</p>

    <h3>Water Tracking Included</h3>
    <p>VitaCal includes built-in water tracking with daily goals and quick-add buttons. Cal AI requires a separate app or manual tracking for hydration.</p>

    <h2>When Cal AI Might Be Better</h2>
    <p>Cal AI has a larger user base and community features like groups and social sharing. If community accountability is important to you, Cal AI may be worth the higher price. Cal AI also offers progress photos and a broader food database.</p>
